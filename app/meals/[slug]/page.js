            <h1>Spicy Garlic Butter Shrimp with Fresh Herbs and Lemon Zest</h1>
            <p>
            Tender, juicy shrimp seared to perfection in a rich garlic butter sauce,
             elevated with a kick of red chili flakes, a splash of lemon juice,
              and a sprinkle of fresh parsley. This vibrant dish delivers bold flavor with every bite
               and comes together in just 20 minutesâ€”ideal for weeknight dinners or
                impressive last-minute entertaining. Serve it over rice, pasta,
                 or with crusty bread to soak up the delicious sauce.
